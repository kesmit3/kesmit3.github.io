Summary of Analysis
Current State Issues
The existing purpose-engine-v2.html has several fundamental problems:

Emoji Encoding — All emojis are garbled (showing ðŸŽ¯ instead of 🎯)
Single Page — 1,400+ lines in one file, only Teacher View is built
Missing 5 of 6 Views — The JSX prototype has Architecture, Problem, Student Dashboard, Purpose Bridge, and Future Self views that don't exist in HTML
No Navigation — Can't switch between views
No Integration Status Bar — Missing the PowerSchool/Schoology/Schoolinks live status indicators
