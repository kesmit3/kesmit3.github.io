      but how intentionally we choose to shape it.

      I chose to work on this because understanding matters. Over the past two years, I have studied,
      experimented, and listened—through formal coursework, industry conferences, applied technical
      training, and ongoing conversations with students and educators.

      My background in theology and ethics informs how I think about responsibility, environmental
      impact, and human dignity. As a parent, I am motivated by something simpler: I want technology
      to help children grow into capable, connected adults.
