            <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm Kim! A tech and business leader with a knack for seeing between the present and possible to solve complex problems and spark action towards innovation. But beyond my professional work, there's a lot that makes me who I am:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Wife to an amazing social impact innovator and mom of an energetic youngster.</li>
                <li>Dog mom too. And... cat. Yes, we rescued a cate from my office building. Pegasus.</li>
                <li>Faith. Family. Learning. Listening.</li>
                <li>When I was growing up I was a jock. I placed 3rd in the US Junior Olympics (1993) – a proud moment of my athletic journey.</li>
                <li>I received the Intel Squadron of the Year award as the only telecoms and lowest-ranking female to do so in the 94th Intel Squadron. Early on the cyber scene and when people were still arguing about the internet.</li>
                <li>Art published in one of Ken Wilber's books. Created a video called "The Twitter Experiment" to document a project we did while I was looking for creative ways to use Twitter, now X, in the classroom. Check it out below:</li>
